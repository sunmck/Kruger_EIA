# Analyzing Changes of Vegetation in Small Elephant Impact Areas of Kruger National Park based on Satellite Imagery
## Introduction
Welcome to the Kruger Git Pt. 1 of the Internship at Kruger National Park's Scientific Services. Here, we present a collection of multiple approaches 
using different remote sensing products to analyse changes of the savanna vegetation in the national park due to the impact of the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana). The aim is to see if we can confirm changes in vegetation that have been recorded by game rangers in the field in remote sensing data.

In this project, changes of vegetation cover are analysed in the Kruger National Park (KNP) via satellite remote sensing products. These include vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) as well as Land Cover Classifications. 

## Background
The impact of the African Elephant as an "environmental engineer" is a highly discussed topic in the Kruger National Park amongst many other. Whist elephants act to 
curb woody thickening and therefore structuring the physical environment with positive consequences for other fauna, they are feared to potentially decrease biodiversity
by debarking and knocking down specific tree species such as the Marula (Sclerocarya birrea) and Knobthorn (Acacia nigrescens) trees. Areas of high elephant impact are therefore assumed to have a stronger trend towards an opening of savanna vegetation and a declie of large trees in comparison to areas of lower elephant impact.

## Scripts
Please download the scripts and the data folder and change the directories respectively.

### MODIS_VI_timeseries.R
This script ....

### 2019_NoElA.py
An exemplary Python script (for the QGIS Python console) to generate the nested area diagramms to display the difference in land cover within and outside of the EIAs for different time stamps.

### TSGraphsLC.R
This R script takes the preprocessed (QGIS) shapefiles of the land cover data and generates a time series plot to compare the development of the different, relevant, land cover classes within and outside of the EIAs.
